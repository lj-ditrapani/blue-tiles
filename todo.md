- separate idea of valid check & update
- Create isPlayValid for factory and board
- delete Result type
- check factory.isPlayValid(play), board.isPlayValid(play)
    - then do factory.update & board.update if both valid
- check if board.isValid properly checks for wrong color on existing colored PatternLine
- board.nextFirstPlayer disapeared after being properly assigned...
- implement server-side play
- make game anti-cheat
    - update(play) function should return success/error
        - error if play is an illegal move
- Adding tiles to Board floor:
    - if more than floor slots, put remainder in trash
- dockerize
