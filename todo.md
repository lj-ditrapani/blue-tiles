    - 2 phases
        - factory offer
        - wall tiling (scoring)
- need winner: Player? field
    - null means game is on
    - Player means game is over
- Rename Location item to remove clash
- Play row needs to become Play move : Row | Floor
- PlayRecord needs firstPlayer: Maybe field!
    - once we applyPlay on factory, we should know the tileCount taken AND if firstPlayer was taken
    - then create PlayRecord
    - use firstPlayer field to update board
- create frontend skeleton
    - calls register
    - Loop call ready
        - once true, stop and proceed
    - Loop call status -> shows status payload
        - once your turn, stop update UI for player's turn
    - Collect fields: location, color, row
    - Button play -> calls play -> shows result -> return to status loop
- post register: on count == 3; -> ready to play
- dockerize
- make game anti-cheat
    - update(play) function should return success/error
        - error if play is an illegla move
