- Game: add last move (player#, location, color, count, row) to Game to be displayed in UI
- Send which player # made the request back in the response
- Before game is ready
    - need 3 players to join
- Make data classe mutable?
    - creating the a new factory (at begining AND each round)
      requires mutating the supply AND maybe the trash
- get ready
    - returns false + number of present/missing players
    - return true when all 3 players are registered
- get status
    - send status of game
- post play
- create frontend skeleton
    - calls register
    - Loop call ready
        - once true, stop and proceed
    - Loop call status -> shows status payload
        - once your turn, stop update UI for player's turn
    - Collect fields: location, color, row
    - Button play -> calls play -> shows result -> return to status loop
- post register: on count == 3; -> ready to play
- dockerize
